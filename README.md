# Starting a Local PostgreSQL Database with Docker

You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

### 1. Create a file in the root of your project, you can name it start-database.sh.

### 2. Paste the shell script from this repo into it.

### 3. In the terminal, simply type:
```
./start-database.sh
```

This will create a Docker container with PostgreSQL running locally.

This script is inspired by the [T3 Starter](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app)
